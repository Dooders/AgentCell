Biological Background
Structure: 
    Membrane-bound organelles containing hydrolytic enzymes.
Function:
    Digestion: 
        Breaks down macromolecules, damaged organelles, and pathogens.
    Autophagy: 
        Recycles cellular components.
Modeling Considerations
    Enzymatic Activity:
        Model enzyme-substrate interactions.
    pH Dependency:
        Lysosomal enzymes are active at acidic pH; simulate environmental conditions.
