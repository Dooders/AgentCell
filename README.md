# Pyology

Pyology is a metaphorical model of a biological cell, implemented as a Python library. It provides a framework for simulating cellular processes and metabolic pathways.

## Features

- Simulates various cellular components and organelles
- Models metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and the Krebs cycle
- Implements energy production mechanisms (ATP synthesis)
- Provides a flexible and extensible architecture for cellular simulations

## Installation

To install Pyology, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install pyology
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use Pyology:

```python
from pyology.cell import Cell
from pyology.simulation import Reporter, SimulationController

# Create a cell and simulation components
cell = Cell()
reporter = Reporter()
sim_controller = SimulationController(cell, reporter)

# Run a simulation with a specific amount of glucose
glucose_amount = 4
results = sim_controller.run_simulation(glucose_amount)

# Access and analyze the results
print(f"Final ATP: {results['final_cytoplasm_atp'] + results['final_mitochondrion_atp']:.2f}")
```

For more detailed examples and usage instructions, please refer to the documentation.

## Components

Pyology includes the following main components:

- Cell
- Mitochondrion
- Cytoplasm
- Krebs Cycle
- Endoplasmic Reticulum
- Golgi Apparatus
- Cell Membrane

Each component is modeled to represent its biological counterpart and interact with other components in the simulation.
