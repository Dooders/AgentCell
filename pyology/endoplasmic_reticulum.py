Biological Background
Structure:
    Rough ER (RER): 
        Studded with ribosomes; 
        continuous with the nuclear envelope.
    Smooth ER (SER): 
        Lacks ribosomes; 
        tubular structure.
Function:
    RER: 
        Synthesizes and folds proteins destined for membranes or secretion.
    SER: 
        Synthesizes lipids, metabolizes carbohydrates, detoxifies drugs.
Modeling Considerations
    Protein Synthesis and Folding:
        Model co-translational translocation into the ER.
        Include chaperone-mediated folding.
    Lipid Synthesis:
        Simulate synthesis of phospholipids and steroids.
